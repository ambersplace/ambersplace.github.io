Linux users have a deserved rep for being assholes who just tell people to search and read the docs.

But search is garbage these days, documentation on open source projects has largely sucked for a long time, and helping is just the decent thing to do.

So yeah, feel free to ask me about linux stuff. Send asks, leave a comment here, doesn't matter. Compatibility, differences between distros/desktops/whatever, troubleshooting. It's all on the table.

Experience includes years of working as a sysadmin (small business and corporate), data center technical operations, and also lots of personal use spanning decades, and using a wide range and variety of distributions.

Most distros will have guided partition setups, and some may prompt you to use the existing EFI partition Windows has setup, but if you manually create an EFI parition (usually formatted FAT32 (which some installers will call just FAT)) and set its mount point /boot/efi and set that to Bootable (if the option is there), it should just use that. This way, the two OSes are completely separate, and if you blow away one drive the other OS will continue to work fine.\n\nThis also has the benefit of allowing you to use your motherboard boot menu to select which OS to boot from, and specify the default in the UEFI setup. If your distro uses GRUB or GRUB2, you can optionally (if it isn't enabled by default) set an option in grub's config called os-prober that will scan for other operating systems including Windows and automatically add a boot option for it, so you can just select either in the grub boot menu (timeouts can also be customized, and even the theme if you're interested).\n\nIf you have an existing linux install and want to install Windows after, just disconnect the linux drive physically, then install Windows on the empty drive, then once its totally done, shut down and reconnect the linux drive.\n","children":[{"comment":{"commentId":"1b476046-8352-4400-9e4c-657b0d1528e6","postedAtISO":"2024-05-29T04:10:12.073Z","deleted":false,"body":"Thank you very much :eggbug-smile-hearts: :eggbug-smile-hearts: :eggbug-smile-hearts:\n","children":[],"postId":6139516,"inReplyTo":"a63615c1-de52-4737-9872-f889d67def85","hasCohostPlus":true,"hidden":false},"canInteract":"not-allowed","canEdit":"not-allowed","canHide":"not-allowed","poster":{"projectId":158561,"handle":"Space-G","displayName":"Space-G","dek":"The Brazillian Menace™","description":"Discord username: spaceg\n\nProfile picture drawn by [matsukun at Twitter](https://x.com/matsunkun?t=I1SqDJVW_WiSw1RYZNhUnA\\&s=09)\n","avatarURL":"../../rc/avatar/158561-dfe16e61-b923-4dc4-a118-e746a7253a24-profile.png","avatarPreviewURL":"../../rc/avatar/158561-dfe16e61-b923-4dc4-a118-e746a7253a24-profile.png","headerURL":null,"headerPreviewURL":null,"privacy":"public","url":"http://spaceg.xyz/","pronouns":"She/Her","flags":[],"avatarShape":"circle","loggedOutPostVisibility":"public","frequentlyUsedTags":[],"askSettings":{"enabled":true,"allowAnon":false,"requireLoggedInAnon":true},"contactCard":[{"service":"Fediverse","value":"https://meow.social/@spaceg","visibility":"public"},{"service":"Website League","value":"lilypad.frogge.cafe/@spaceg","visibility":"public"}],"deleteAfter":null,"isSelfProject":null}}],"postId":6139516,"inReplyTo":"053d0734-f1a1-492a-a81b-4776a6a44027","hasCohostPlus":true,"hidden":false},"canInteract":"not-allowed","canEdit":"not-allowed","canHide":"not-allowed","poster":{"projectId":190926,"handle":"purpleraccoon","displayName":"","dek":"","description":"","avatarURL":"../../rc/avatar/190926-c726c897-47bd-4a9b-a0d8-da5841a2081f-profile.png","avatarPreviewURL":"../../rc/avatar/190926-c726c897-47bd-4a9b-a0d8-da5841a2081f-profile.png","headerURL":null,"headerPreviewURL":null,"privacy":"private","url":"","pronouns":"","flags":[],"avatarShape":"squircle","loggedOutPostVisibility":"none","frequentlyUsedTags":[],"askSettings":{"enabled":true,"allowAnon":false,"requireLoggedInAnon":true},"contactCard":[{"service":"Signal","value":"pr0mptcr1t1cal.117","visibility":"following-you"},{"service":"Telegram","value":"@linaraccoon","visibility":"following-you"},{"service":"Blog -

I’ve written stuff that runs on Linux too, but it has always run server side and I just dealt with some flavor of either  Debian or Fedora at the end of an SSH.\n\nThe last time I tried to run Linux on a desktop it was decades ago. Things seem… different these days. I want my hardware to work (printing! Sound! Games maybe?) I want to be able to make it pretty. I don’t want to feel trapped by a bad decision. I want to be able to learn what all is running and how it all fits together eventually.\n\nSo… I’m new but not ignorant, if that makes sense.\n\nWhat distribution should I be running?\n","children":[{"comment":{"commentId":"f70ff65e-65df-44fb-9636-6fc1ff4a59b7","postedAtISO":"2024-06-02T06:37:47.826Z","deleted":false,"body":"So, the nice thing about printers, sound, and other peripherals is that things are a hell of a lot better than they were even 10 years ago. Sound largely just works unless you're using bleeding edge hardware on certain laptops (and even that's been pretty much sorted, as mine started working with kernel 6.8), and printers connected via USB also tend to pretty much just work (as long as you have CUPS installed, and sometimes an extra package like hplip for HP printers, depending on the manufacturer and the distro you're using).\n\nGames are also largely straightforward...ish. With Steam, you can enable Proton for even unsupported titles so most Windows games are playable, and non-steam games can often work with Lutris (there are usually templates available on their site to autoconfigure them). Games that have DRM that ties into the Windows kernel are a no-go, tho.\n\nSo...in terms of an actual distro, that's the hardest easy question ever.\n\nMy distro of choice these days is OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. I prefer it because it's a rolling release, and I don't have to do big upgraded to major new versions every six months, but it's also more prone to breaking on certain updates. Not something I generally recommend unless you're really comfortable with an RPM package system and getting your hands dirty unfucking things that lead to issues booting.\n\nDebian is an easy recommendation, as long as you aren't running bleeding edge hardware, as the kernel and packages are Stable, but Old (even if you choose Debian Unstable, which isn't really unstable, just less aggressively tested than the Stable release). As there are so many distros based on it, it's usually pretty safe to assume that most software will be packaged for it, but again, bleeding edge stuff may pose a problem.\n\nI really can't in good conscience recommend Ubuntu anymore, as Canonical is turning into the Microsoft of the linux world (I'd need an essay on that one), but I do recommend Mint, which is based on Ubuntu, and and especially if you have an Nvidia GPU - it's one of the best distros to get quickly up-and-running with that hardware).\n\nFedora...doesn't really get my recommendation anymore. It's widely supported, sure, but every time I use it I have more trouble than it's worth and switch back to OpenSUSE (which again I should mention is RPM-based like Fedora, and a lot of things that say they only support Fedora but provide an RPM will usually just work on OpenSUSE as well).\n\nMost distros offer Spins/variations with different desktop environments, and if you've only ever really interacted with linux via SSH, I'd generally suggest starting with KDE, as it'll be most familiar and polished. All of the distros I've mentioned allow you to have multiple desktop environments installed at the same time, so even if you start there and want to experiment with others, it's usually pretty easy to install another, reboot, and at the login screen select another one.\n\nSo in summary, Mint is an excellent place to start, especially if you have Nvidia hardware. I do recommend OpenSUSE (either Tumbleweed for very fast updates, or Slowroll for a more stable setup) if you're already comfortable enough to get your hands dirty.\n\nMy biggest recommendation, tho, is to grab a few, get them on USB drives, and boot them in Live mode and play around with them. See what works for you! If something really catches your eye,\n","children":[{"comment":{"commentId":"99f004ef-a1d5-49ae-bf41-e4596418612a","postedAtISO":"2024-06-03T12:44:34.961Z","deleted":false,"body":"Thank you so much for the recommendation!

<!-- --><p>Generally I recommend that if you're starting fresh, wipe the OS drives (backing up anything on them you need first, of course), and then installing Windows first, and your linux distro on the other drive second. Most distros will have guided partition setups, and some may prompt you to use the existing EFI partition Windows has setup, but if you manually create an EFI parition (usually formatted FAT32 (which some installers will call just FAT)) and set its mount point /boot/efi and set that to Bootable (if the option is there), it should just use that. This way, the two OSes are completely separate, and if you blow away one drive the other OS will continue to work fine.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>This also has the benefit of allowing you to use your motherboard boot menu to select which OS to boot from, and specify the default in the UEFI setup. If your distro uses GRUB or GRUB2, you can optionally (if it isn't enabled by default) set an option in grub's config called os-prober that will scan for other operating systems including Windows and automatically add a boot option for it, so you can just select either in the grub boot menu (timeouts can also be customized, and even the theme if you're interested).<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>If you have an existing linux install and want to install Windows after, just disconnect the linux drive physically, then install Windows on the empty drive, then once its totally done, shut down and reconnect the linux drive.<!-- --></p></div><div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2"><span class="co-link-button-disabled flex cursor-not-allowed

Sound largely just works unless you're using bleeding edge hardware on certain laptops (and even that's been pretty much sorted, as mine started working with kernel 6.8), and printers connected via USB also tend to pretty much just work (as long as you have CUPS installed, and sometimes an extra package like hplip for HP printers, depending on the manufacturer and the distro you're using).<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Games are also largely straightforward...ish. With Steam, you can enable Proton for even unsupported titles so most Windows games are playable, and non-steam games can often work with Lutris (there are usually templates available on their site to autoconfigure them). Games that have DRM that ties into the Windows kernel are a no-go, tho.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>So...in terms of an actual distro, that's the hardest easy question ever.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>My distro of choice these days is OpenSUSE Tumbleweed. I prefer it because it's a rolling release, and I don't have to do big upgraded to major new versions every six months, but it's also more prone to breaking on certain updates. Not something I generally recommend unless you're really comfortable with an RPM package system and getting your hands dirty unfucking things that lead to issues booting.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Debian is an easy recommendation, as long as you aren't running bleeding edge hardware, as the kernel and packages are Stable, but Old (even if you choose Debian Unstable, which isn't really unstable, just less aggressively tested than the Stable release). As there are so many distros based on it, it's usually pretty safe to assume that most software will be packaged for it, but again, bleeding edge stuff may pose a problem.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>I really can't in good conscience recommend Ubuntu anymore, as Canonical is turning into the Microsoft of the linux world (I'd need an essay on that one), but I do recommend Mint, which is based on Ubuntu, and and especially if you have an Nvidia GPU - it's one of the best distros to get quickly up-and-running with that hardware).<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Fedora...doesn't really get my recommendation anymore. It's widely supported, sure, but every time I use it I have more trouble than it's worth and switch back to OpenSUSE (which again I should mention is RPM-based like Fedora, and a lot of things that say they only support Fedora but provide an RPM will usually just work on OpenSUSE as well).<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Most distros offer Spins/variations with different desktop environments, and if you've only ever really interacted with linux via SSH, I'd generally suggest starting with KDE, as it'll be most familiar and polished. All of the distros I've mentioned allow you to have multiple desktop environments installed at the same time, so even if you start there and want to experiment with others, it's usually pretty easy to install another, reboot, and at the login screen select another one.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>So in summary, Mint is an excellent place to start, especially if you have Nvidia hardware. I do recommend OpenSUSE (either Tumbleweed for very fast updates, or Slowroll for a more stable setup) if you're already comfortable enough to get your hands dirty.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>My biggest recommendation, tho, is to grab a few, get them on USB drives, and boot them in Live mode and play around with them. See what works for you! If something really catches your eye,<!-- --></p></div><div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2"><span class="co-link-button-disabled flex cursor-not-allowed
