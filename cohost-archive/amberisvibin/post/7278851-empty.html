i implement this. much later, QA reports a bug: the chance of a treasure chest spawning isn't one in six. uhhh ok. i have a look and can't repro. i look at the code and it's the same &quot;random chance&quot; code used everywhere, so if there was anything wrong with it, this wouldn't be where it came up. i have a bit more of a think and then send it back, CNR.

the bug bounces back and forth for 2 weeks as the tester keeps saying it's still not one in six. i am down a few rabbit holes thinking about, could we be not spawning the chest even though the result comes in true? is some other class destroying chests? are some levels containing instances of the haystack that are busted in some way? much to think about

eventually i'm like, ok, what exactly are you seeing in your repro. old mate says &quot;i burn 6 haystacks. sometimes there's no treasure chest at all. sometimes i burn 6 haystacks and get more than one treasure chest. so that's not a 1 in 6 chance&quot;

i now have a new, much more challenging task: explain this without embarassing anyone"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:type" content="article"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:published_time" content="2024-08-13T01:33:38.259Z"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:author" content="https://cohost.org/joewintergreen"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:url" content="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/7278851-empty"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="gamedev"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="game dev tales"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image" content="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/avatar/5545-4616fac7-dd38-42ea-bef8-46ae495a805b-profile.jpg"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:alt" content="joewintergreen"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:width" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:height" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:card" content="summary">

It's reasonable to say that this should massage numbers towards the middle of the total number range, making it less likely to miss high chance shots or hit low chance ones (fitting the player's broken understanding of probability better).\n\nI'd also be tempted to have a value in the background that tracks the player's luck and secretly gives them an advantage/disadvantage on their rolls depending on what kind of luck they've been having.\n\nAnother option for randomness is to roll a random number within a range and then decrement that value each time a specific event occurs, and only do the special thing whenever that value hits zero.

Like, just hard to think about. Probably the most respectful way to explain this is to show a normal distribution? Then you're not calling them an idjit or whatever you're just having a conversation about math.\n\nI thought there was a thing called the \"Chernoff bound\" that was a specific way of measuring \"the more trials you do, the more likely your 1/N probability is to get exactly N successes\", but looking it up on Google now it might be something more complicated. Math Wikipedia used to be more readable than it is now.\n\nBy the way, in addition to Strawberry Fox's proposal above to make your random numbers seem subjectively \"more random\" by making the distribution more \"lumpy\", another interesting approach is to do something like the \"7bag\" approach in modern Tetris, which has the effective result of forcing probability to act like \"intuitive\" probability rather than \"real\" probability. For example, in the haystack case, instead of calculating a 1/6 probability, every 6 haystacks you generate you could pick a number between 1 and 6, and for example if your random number is 4 then you put a single treasure chest under the 4th haystack. I'm not sure this is as fun as true probability, but it would result in nice clean \"works as expected\" properties like \"if there are 36 haystacks there are exactly 6 chests\".\n","children":[{"comment":{"commentId":"191f45b2-3f72-4a1c-8ce8-a2d4db32f6a0","postedAtISO":"2024-08-22T05:06:09.298Z","deleted":false,"body":"Yeah, probability is just hard to think about.

a game. the game has haystacks sometimes. if you set fire to the haystack, there's a one in six chance that when it burns away, it turns out to contain a treasure chest! you can get some loot<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>i implement this. much later, QA reports a bug: the chance of a treasure chest spawning isn't one in six. uhhh ok. i have a look and can't repro. i look at the code and it's the same "random chance" code used everywhere, so if there was anything wrong with it, this wouldn't be where it came up. i have a bit more of a think and then send it back, CNR.<!-- --></p>

You both want to ensure the jam happens eventually (the cost of cheap ammo) and avoid too much streakiness, but don't want to eliminate bad streaks - so within each ammo quality I'd recommend setting up a maximum jam streak you want it to be allowed have, and if it hits that, protecting it from further jams until the chances feel more evened out, then starting the chance cycle on it again. For example: "questionable ex-Soviet surplus 7.62," jam chance 10% (builds up to guaranteed 10th shot jam), streak ceiling 3/grace period 5 (if it jams 3x in a row, the next 5 shots will go to 0% jam, then the 6th after the streak will return to base jam chance).<!-- --></p></div><div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2"><span class="co-link-button-disabled flex cursor-not-allowed

Like, just hard to think about. Probably the most respectful way to explain this is to show a normal distribution? Then you're not calling them an idjit or whatever you're just having a conversation about math.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>I thought there was a thing called the "Chernoff bound" that was a specific way of measuring "the more trials you do, the more likely your 1/N probability is to get exactly N successes", but looking it up on Google now it might be something more complicated. Math Wikipedia used to be more readable than it is now.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>By the way, in addition to Strawberry Fox's proposal above to make your random numbers seem subjectively "more random" by making the distribution more "lumpy", another interesting approach is to do something like the "7bag" approach in modern Tetris, which has the effective result of forcing probability to act like "intuitive" probability rather than "real" probability. For example, in the haystack case, instead of calculating a 1/6 probability, every 6 haystacks you generate you could pick a number between 1 and 6, and for example if your random number is 4 then you put a single treasure chest under the 4th haystack. I'm not sure this is as fun as true probability, but it would result in nice clean "works as expected" properties like "if there are 36 haystacks there are exactly 6 chests".<!-- --></p></div><div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2"><span class="co-link-button-disabled flex cursor-not-allowed
