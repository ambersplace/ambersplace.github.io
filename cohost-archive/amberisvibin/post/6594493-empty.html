 1. chinese has (put simply) 4 tones:

 2. the word they chose for enjoy is 享受。享 is third tone, and you can see from the above picture that the third tone is more complicated than the other ones. kind of like an enlongated vowel in japanese, the third tone also just takes a bit longer to say.

so you can see how the word was chosen specifically because its starting tone makes it stand out from the rest of the sentence. its only noticable if you can say the sentence out loud, and it is completely lost in translation.

also tied into the interpretation is culture -- i know its a common and tired American joke that Chinese products are poor quality. While obviously completely false, there ARE cheap products, and especially for earbuds people tend to just go for the cheaper ones because they dont care much about the quality compared to price. so this marketing team is trying to say quality does matter.

ok rant over."><meta data-rh="true" property="og:type" content="article"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:published_time" content="2024-06-24T16:15:41.975Z"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:author" content="https://cohost.org/kyn"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:url" content="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/6594493-empty"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image" content="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/avatar/380-b8f59e8f-800a-4e20-b193-061254c2ef42-profile.png"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:alt" content="kyn"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:width" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:height" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:card" content="summary">
