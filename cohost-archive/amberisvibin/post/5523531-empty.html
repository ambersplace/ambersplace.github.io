Moore's Conjecture (shouldn't call it a law anymore) hit the wall of quantum physics a decade and change ago.

The money stopped correlating to innovation around the time the first dot com bubble burst. That was when the screws started to tighten. Vulture capital worked to pump and dump start-ups, and the proceeds of the cannibalistic financial rituals sunk into the housing market to inflate the bubble that would burst in 2008 - and leave big banks through their deregulated investment arms owning the big agribusinesses that owned and operated most of the farmland in the USA. The ones for whom aggressive immigration control to the point of genocide is useful because it lets them get defacto slave labor from &quot;illegal immigrants.&quot;

We're now looking at a market structured more hostile to actual innovation than anyone could've designed on purpose. Actual innovation is risky. Big investors always want to eliminate risks - so the money never goes to real innovation. It goes to new ways to play finance games (cryptocurrency) and new excuses to underpay by claiming skilled labor is replaced or deskilled (stochastic parrots known erroneously as AI). If you want funding, you've got to be totally sure how it'll make money when you make your thing. That means only ideas already easily understood by the kind of stupid old white men who have control of billions of dollars can be pursued. You can try to pursue other things, but you won't get big investment, so you'll lack resources constantly."><meta data-rh="true" property="og:type" content="article"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:published_time" content="2024-04-11T06:58:04.168Z"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:author" content="https://cohost.org/IkomaTanomori"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:url" content="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/5523531-empty"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="furthermore capitalism must be destroyed"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image" content="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/avatar/88551-aeed55b3-b4a4-4376-afa6-e7c4df129b3b-profile.png"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:alt" content="IkomaTanomori"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:width" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:height" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:card" content="summary">

What I really REALLY don't get is giving credit to a guy, who at least to me, really feels like one of The Most Horrible Villains, even if I've been propagandized to hell and back (probably), like, what reason to I have to consider that he might have been good, when (from what I can tell), his ideas and approaches to governance fundamentally go against so much of what I've come to believe? Yeah, you could say I think \"evil\" is real, but it's not metaphysical or physical, it's human but it isn't inherent. \"Disagreement\", as much as western capitalism has utterly butchered its meaning and utility (hi I live in the US and it fucking sucks), is still a good thing, I think. The issue I see is when (read: all the time) such flimsy language is used to describe the horrid notion that ruthless partisan assaults on the concept of humanity pertaining to: public health practices, socioeconomic desolation, ultimate authority (there shouldn't be any), the level of \"humanity\" certain people possess, the idea that it's okay to treat people worse if they were born elsewhere, etc., is something that can be resolved through \"debate\" and a 4 year-old's understanding of \"compromise\". <--- THAT'S SO FUCKED UP AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. So...\n\nYou've hardly given me any reason to seriously consider that I might be utterly, completely, 100% Wrong about Stalin. I can not deny there's a chance that literally everything I've heard about him is a lie, but that's not enough for me to think, \"oh, this is worthy of serious research\". I don't want any dictators, anymore, ever. I don't want endless wars, conflict of scales I'm unable to comprehend in a lifetime's worth of time, this notion that we're all different and therefore alone. What does reading Stalin uncritically do for any of that? If there's something there, it has to be more than just vague language about my not understanding what is good about killing your political opponents and stifling the development of art and humanitarian study.

I'm the time since then, we've only seen the gradual improvements in efficiency of economies of scale. Moore's Conjecture (shouldn't call it a law anymore) hit the wall of quantum physics a decade and change ago.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>The money stopped correlating to innovation around the time the first dot com bubble burst. That was when the screws started to tighten. Vulture capital worked to pump and dump start-ups, and the proceeds of the cannibalistic financial rituals sunk into the housing market to inflate the bubble that would burst in 2008 - and leave big banks through their deregulated investment arms owning the big agribusinesses that owned and operated most of the farmland in the USA. The ones for whom aggressive immigration control to the point of genocide is useful because it lets them get defacto slave labor from "illegal immigrants."<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>We're now looking at a market structured more hostile to actual innovation than anyone could've designed on purpose. Actual innovation is risky. Big investors always want to eliminate risks - so the money never goes to real innovation. It goes to new ways to play finance games (cryptocurrency) and new excuses to underpay by claiming skilled labor is replaced or deskilled (stochastic parrots known erroneously as AI). If you want funding, you've got to be totally sure how it'll make money when you make your thing. That means only ideas already easily understood by the kind of stupid old white men who have control of billions of dollars can be pursued.

<!-- --><p>I get that history is a big messy knot that none of us have figured out, or ever will be able to. What I really REALLY don't get is giving credit to a guy, who at least to me, really feels like one of The Most Horrible Villains, even if I've been propagandized to hell and back (probably), like, what reason to I have to consider that he might have been good, when (from what I can tell), his ideas and approaches to governance fundamentally go against so much of what I've come to believe? Yeah, you could say I think "evil" is real, but it's not metaphysical or physical, it's human but it isn't inherent. "Disagreement", as much as western capitalism has utterly butchered its meaning and utility (hi I live in the US and it fucking sucks), is still a good thing, I think. The issue I see is when (read: all the time) such flimsy language is used to describe the horrid notion that ruthless partisan assaults on the concept of humanity pertaining to: public health practices, socioeconomic desolation, ultimate authority (there shouldn't be any), the level of "humanity" certain people possess, the idea that it's okay to treat people worse if they were born elsewhere, etc., is something that can be resolved through "debate" and a 4 year-old's understanding of "compromise". &lt;--- THAT'S SO FUCKED UP AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT. So...<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>You've hardly given me any reason to seriously consider that I might be utterly, completely, 100% Wrong about Stalin. I can not deny there's a chance that literally everything I've heard about him is a lie, but that's not enough for me to think, "oh, this is worthy of serious research". I don't want any dictators, anymore, ever. I don't want endless wars, conflict of scales I'm unable to comprehend in a lifetime's worth of time, this notion that we're all different and therefore alone. What does reading Stalin uncritically do for any of that? If there's something there, it has to be more than just vague language about my not understanding what is good about killing your political opponents and stifling the development of art and humanitarian study.
