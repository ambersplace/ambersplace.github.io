OP IS SLIGHTLY INACCURATE: THIS ISN'T &quot;EA'S ANTI-CHEAT&quot;

The (potential) bug is actually in Easy Anti-Cheat. It's an easy mistake to make, since the acronym is EAC, but I don't think they're affiliated with EA at all. Their logo is this:

[https://cohost.org/rc/attachment-redirect/967f42fc-d93c-494d-8b1d-06f172053ea6]

You can see the official list of games that use it here [https://www.easy.ac/en-us/partners/], but it's not exhaustive. This site [https://levvvel.com/games-with-kernel-level-anti-cheat-software/] lists all games. There are some big names on there, like Fortnite and Elden Ring.

Also note that, according to the article above, it's still unknown whether the exploit was actually in the anti-cheat or in Apex Legends specifically, or exactly what level of privilege escalation it attains. Fully reinstalling your OS and changing every password is definitely the safest option, but if the cost of doing so would be onerous for you it may be worth waiting a day or two and seeing how big the blast radius is."><meta data-rh="true" property="og:type" content="article"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:published_time" content="2024-03-18T09:59:20.237Z"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:author" content="https://cohost.org/nex3-reposts"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:url" content="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/5147759-empty"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="apex legends"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="apex hack"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="hacking"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image" content="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/avatar/19624-dcb0f213-03ae-4259-87da-f0413e9096a8-profile.webp"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:alt" content="nex3-reposts"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:width" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:height" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:card" content="summary">
