Like obviously part of it is that but. I find that a lot of internet safety \"rules\" outright don't cover the extent of what you can get into online. I didn't realise for a very long time that I was/was almost groomed because it just didn't fit into the box of what I was taught an internet predator was. I honestly think a huge part of it is that internet safety just isn't taught very well.\n\nFor me I saw both worlds - one where if you so much as give out your first name online someone will come to your house and take you away, and one where predators are obviously evil but hilariously easy to spot so youre never in any real danger because youll just know when someones trying to groom you. neither of these portrayals are all that good. when a kid inevitably finds out that giving out their name and birthday doesnt get them taken right off their front yard, they usually start to think its all bullshit. when a kid thinks all predators are stupid fucking idiots, they start to think it could never happen to them.\n\ni do think some of the \"kid friendly\" attempts ive seen are kinda just looking for trouble. ive seen servers that try to exclusively have under-18s in their servers. it leaves a horrible taste in my mouth.\nbut what else are they supposed to do? most of the sites kids used to go to are now just hubs for mobile games. you cant go on nickelodeon or cartoon network and play flash games anymore. the average kid isnt going to know what a flashpoint or a ruffle is either. we dont really have any decent third spaces for kids online or in real

Like obviously part of it is that but. I find that a lot of internet safety "rules" outright don't cover the extent of what you can get into online. I didn't realise for a very long time that I was/was almost groomed because it just didn't fit into the box of what I was taught an internet predator was. I honestly think a huge part of it is that internet safety just isn't taught very well.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>For me I saw both worlds - one where if you so much as give out your first name online someone will come to your house and take you away, and one where predators are obviously evil but hilariously easy to spot so youre never in any real danger because youll just know when someones trying to groom you. neither of these portrayals are all that good. when a kid inevitably finds out that giving out their name and birthday doesnt get them taken right off their front yard, they usually start to think its all bullshit. when a kid thinks all predators are stupid fucking idiots, they start to think it could never happen to them.<!-- --></p>
