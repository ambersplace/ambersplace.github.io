I don't really like being perceived--if at all--but what pushed me over the edge was the fact that there are so few [https://x.com/oh_itsjustjamie/status/1832578654812991867] Asian [https://x.com/Ranting_Trans/status/1823604007522459664] trans [https://x.com/status_unown/status/1832176109489705087] timelines.

That counts for something. It must.

I can't go back in time to tell myself that it's going to be okay. Even if I did, she wouldn't believe it. The pain simply hurts too much. When people say &quot;HRT saved my life&quot; there's a gravitas to that statement that often goes unnoticed and an aftermath that must be handled, because it only starts saving your life. You still have to do the rest...and I almost didn't. I've lost track of the amount of times I've wanted to give up. So here's my bare and simple hope: if I can reach just one person and tell them it's going to get better, everything will be worth it.

Please, stay alive. And to my dearest friends who helped me on my journey thus far, all my love. I would not be here otherwise."><meta data-rh="true" property="og:type" content="article"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:published_time" content="2024-09-08T11:51:47.694Z"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:author" content="https://cohost.org/ninecoffees"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:url" content="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/7596680-empty"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="trans"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="selfie"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="6 months E"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image" content="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/c07d0896-4027-4c93-8d82-3b37eeefbf9e/2019.jpg"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image" content="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/21e4aca1-5c11-4f70-99ec-6dfd786087ae/2024.jpg"><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
