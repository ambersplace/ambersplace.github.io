https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDuITB5mDKk [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDuITB5mDKk]

the fucking streamer cam angle changes
this camera, this camera, and THIS camera
the intro that's just half a video of his cat
the patron shoutouts being at the start and having personalized messages
the nutritional breakdown being shared
the immediate cut to him being in the car
with dashcam footage
he took the temperature of the sandwich with a food thermometer and when it was piping hot he played an applause sound effect
surreal weighing segment
the weird cadence of his voice during said segment
the house beats played during the unwrapping segment
it's like watching a porn music video but of a chicken sandwich
playing the footage of him eating it in slow motion and repeating it from multiple angles while more house music plays
but this is the third? different track so far in the video
HE INTERRUPTS IT TO SHOW THAT HE ACTUALLY SNUCK BITES DURING THE CAR RIDE
IN A SMALL CUTAWAY FRAME
JACOB GELLER WASN'T KIDDING
his scoring section he starts talking like an auctioneer
then he just goes SILENT and tips his head down as he takes another bite and tries to think of a rating
gives the score with a BOOM sound effect and pounding the desk
then says goodbye and the video just ends, no outro no nothing. that's it.

<!-- --><p>the fucking streamer cam angle changes<!-- --><br>
this camera, this camera, and THIS camera<!-- --><br>
the intro that's just half a video of his cat<!-- --><br>
the patron shoutouts being at the start and having personalized messages<!-- --><br>
the nutritional breakdown being shared<!-- --><br>
the immediate cut to him being in the car<!-- --><br>
with dashcam footage<!-- --><br>
he took the temperature of the sandwich with a food thermometer and when it was piping hot he played an applause sound effect<!-- --><br>
surreal weighing segment<!-- --><br>
the weird cadence of his voice during said segment<!-- --><br>
the house beats played during the unwrapping segment<!-- --><br>
<!-- --><em>it's like watching a porn music video but of a chicken sandwich<!-- --></em><br>
playing the footage of him eating it in slow motion and repeating it from multiple angles while more house music plays<!-- --><br>
but this is the third? different track so far in the video<!-- --><br>
<!-- --><strong>HE INTERRUPTS IT TO SHOW THAT HE ACTUALLY SNUCK BITES DURING THE CAR RIDE<!-- --></strong><br>
<!-- --><strong>IN A SMALL CUTAWAY FRAME<!-- --></strong><br>
<!-- --><em><strong>JACOB GELLER WASN'T KIDDING<!-- --></strong></em><br>
his scoring section he starts talking like an auctioneer<!-- --><br>
then he just goes <!-- --><em>SILENT<!-- --></em> and tips his head down as he takes another bite and tries to think of a rating<!-- --><br>
gives the score with a <!-- --><strong>BOOM<!-- --></strong> sound effect and pounding the desk<!-- --><br>

Somehow he has created a space where if the sneakadoodle Joe did his own review from the car and cut back to studio Joe just for the weights and measures, it would make narrative sense as a distinct thing.<!-- --></p>
