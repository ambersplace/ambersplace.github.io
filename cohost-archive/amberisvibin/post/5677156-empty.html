sonic jumps into the time machine, is presumed dead, shadow takes over, starts a dictatorship, people who still remember sonic look for him, they find sonic (homeless and not allowed to cry), and they go and fucking kill shadow.

its kinda weird how this magazine skips around through issue numbers. they include issues 132 through 144, which all create the setup for why sonic has to jump into the time machine. and it ends with him jumping into the time machine. then it picks back up with 166 and 167 andddd its over to the &quot;sonic universe&quot; comics after that? its all very interesting though. weirdly good amount of depth for a storyline that isn't even really official.

i dont know how i would have understood any of what was happening in here when i was a kid. maybe i eventually understood it when i reread this thing for the 50th time, and then immediately forgot about it because i was a stupid child.

i should actually just sit down and read this shit again shouldnt i?

<!-- --><p>trust me thats the only part of the show you need to watch.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>the premise of this (from my memory) is that this show takes place further back in history from the first game.  this is the origin story of sonic and the freedom fighters. all the main characters are like 5 years old and they are on a mission to find their mother who abandoned them at birth. i didnt pay attention cause i thought the show was annoying and everyone was a baby and i didnt like that.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>important thing is though, the three main characters are sonic, manic, and sonia, and they are all siblings. <!-- --><sub>manic is also green this time yes that was him failing to catch the baby<!-- --></sub></p>

<!-- --><ol>
<!-- --><li>The Sonic games released up to that point (Sonic 1 and 2)<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>Sonic SatAM (the TV show)<!-- --><br>
All the writers had were Sonic, Tails, <!-- --><del>Eggman<!-- --></del> Dr. Robotnik, and the Freedom Fighters (Sally Acorn and co.). So what did they do? They made shit up!<!-- --></li>
<!-- --></ol>
<!-- --><p>Big convoluted storylines! Alternate dimensions! Anti-Sonic! They even made sets of <!-- --><em>underwater<!-- --></em> and <!-- --><em>Australian<!-- --></em> Freedom Fighters for one-off jokes! And when Sonic 3 came out and Knuckles was introduced, the echidnas became a whole Thing with their own tribes and backstories and characters that ended up playing huge roles in the comic's story.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>And <!-- --><em>that<!-- --></em> chost at the top, with the comic book panels, is about an alternate timeline. One where Sonic marries Sally Acorn and becomes the king. He has two kids, and things generally go well for everyone. Then one day he finds out there's trouble with the space-time continuum and his planet would be destroyed. He goes to the past to fix it, but he vanishes and everyone thinks he's dead. He still manages to change the past, though, which shifts the world into an alternate timeline.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Then, with Sonic presumed dead, Shadow conquers his kingdom and turns it into a brutal dictatorship where everyone worships Maria. But some people remember the old timeline where Sonic was king, and they search for him. Eventually, they find him living on the streets, with no home, no wife, and no kids... and <!-- --><strong>that's<!-- --></strong> when the dialog in the first chost happens.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>There's a happy ending, though! They stage a coup, defeat Shadow, and crown Sonic king again. Then he marries Sally once more... and they have kids together!<!-- --></p></div></div><div class="w-full max-w-full p-3"><div class="co-tags relative w-full overflow-y-hidden break-words leading-none max-h-[60px]"><div><a class="mr-2 inline-block text-sm hover:underline  " href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/tagged/sonic">#<!-- -->sonic<!-- --></a><a class="mr-2 inline-block text-sm hover:underline  " href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/tagged/sonic%20the%20hedgehog">#<!-- -->sonic the hedgehog<!-- --></a><a class="mr-2 inline-block text-sm hover:underline  " href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/tagged/sonic%20comics">#<!-- -->sonic comics<!-- --></a><a class="mr-2 inline-block text-sm hover:underline  " href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/tagged/archie%20sonic">#<!-- -->archie sonic<!-- --></a></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 right-2 flex h-5"><span class="co-from-body inline-block h-full bg-gradient-to-l pl-4"></span><button class="co-tags co-opaque inline-block cursor-pointer text-sm font-bold hover:underline">see all</button></div></div></div></div></div><hr class="co-hairline"></div><div><div id="post-5600560" data-testid="post-body-5600560" class="relative -top-20"></div><div class="co-post-header flex flex-row flex-wrap items-center gap-2 px-3 py-2"><div class="flex-0 mask relative aspect-square h-8 w-8  inline-block"><img src="../../rc/avatar/11945-0aa8341e-a11a-4051-8057-ed617f75f746-profile.png" class="mask mask-roundrect h-full w-full object-cover" alt="LeminWedj"></div><a rel="author" href="https://cohost.org/LeminWedj" class="co-project-display-name max-w-full flex-shrink truncate font-atkinson font-bold hover:underline" title="LeminWedj">LeminWedj</a><a href="https://cohost.org/LeminWedj" class="co-project-handle font-atkinson font-normal hover:underline">@<!-- -->LeminWedj<!-- --></a><time datetime="2024-04-17T12:58:59.326Z" class="block flex-none text-xs tabular-nums text-gray-500" title="Wed, Apr 17, 2024, 12:58 PM"><a href="https://cohost.org/LeminWedj/post/5600560-div-style-font-fam" class="hover:underline">4/17/2024, 12:58 PM</a></time></div><div><div><div class=" relative overflow-hidden supports-[overflow:clip]:overflow-clip isolate co-contain-paint" data-post-body="true" data-testid="post-body"><div><div class="flex w-full flex-nowrap content-start justify-between" data-testid="row-0"><button class="group relative w-full flex-initial"><img src="../../rc/attachment/54726070-a2e2-4519-9e57-6e3e3b0fb397/20240417_081448.jpg" class="h-full w-full object-cover" data-attachment-id="54726070-a2e2-4519-9e57-6e3e3b0fb397" alt="a statue of maria in the middle of the city, with citizens beneath praying to it. a big-brother-esque poster saying &quot;the chaotix are watching&quot; is seen in the background." title="a statue of maria in the middle of the city, with citizens beneath praying to it. a big-brother-esque poster saying &quot;the chaotix are watching&quot; is seen in the background." style="aspect-ratio:0.75/1"></button><button class="group relative w-full flex-initial"><img src="../../rc/attachment/f2f4f22b-6156-4aa7-ae86-a8873ef5e8a7/20240417_081243.jpg" class="h-full w-full object-cover" data-attachment-id="f2f4f22b-6156-4aa7-ae86-a8873ef5e8a7" alt="king shadow's sex dungeon. the freedon fighter's mechanic is being interrogated." title="king shadow's sex dungeon. the freedon fighter's mechanic is being interrogated." style="aspect-ratio:0.75/1"></button></div><div class="flex w-full flex-nowrap content-start justify-between" data-testid="row-1"><button class="group relative w-full flex-initial"><img src="../../rc/attachment/461cc667-6384-4946-916e-11d389f68953/20240417_081343.jpg" class="h-full w-full object-cover" data-attachment-id="461cc667-6384-4946-916e-11d389f68953" alt="king shadow getting put in forever time-out, causing sonic to regain status as king" title="king shadow getting put in forever time-out, causing sonic to regain status as king" style="aspect-ratio:0.75/1"></button><button class="group relative w-full flex-initial"><img src="../../rc/attachment/5b153ac6-145a-4198-944c-230b7f91b705/20240417_081400.jpg" class="h-full w-full object-cover" data-attachment-id="5b153ac6-145a-4198-944c-230b7f91b705" alt="sonic and sally about to fuck after reuniting, which is the last page in here." title="sonic and sally about to fuck after reuniting, which is the last page in here." style="aspect-ratio:0.75/1"></button></div></div><div class="co-prose prose my-4 overflow-hidden break-words px-3"><div style="font-family:&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;,&quot;Comic Sans&quot;,&quot;Chalkboard SE&quot;,&quot;Comic Neue&quot;,sans-serif;font-size:large">yep. the whole arc of what happens after mobius gets taken over by shadow is about as short as what that single paragraph describes.

<!-- --><p>its kinda weird how this magazine skips around through issue numbers. they include issues 132 through 144, which all create the setup for why sonic has to jump into the time machine. and it ends with him jumping into the time machine. then it picks back up with 166 and 167 andddd its over to the "sonic universe" comics after that? its all very interesting though. weirdly good amount of depth for a storyline that isn't even really official.<!-- --></p>
