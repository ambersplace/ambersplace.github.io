(genuine question. &quot;sell me&quot; on it i guess, if you use them for portraits)

i will readily admit im a prime &amp; wide angle girlie. i think portraits are more intimate, more full of emotion, when you're in close quarters with someone, but admittedly most of my portrait work is done with people ive known for a long time. is that it??? that 135mm allows you to be further away/more distant from the subject???? &amp; that makes them more comfortable if they don't know you as well??

like. the longest lens ive had any portrait success with so far is 55mm on the x-t2 so 82.5mm equivalent, and even then i felt like i was far too distant from my subject to compose the shot the way i wanted. i don't understand :•|"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:type" content="article"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:published_time" content="2024-08-09T07:17:17.971Z"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:author" content="https://cohost.org/irigraph"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:url" content="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/7233959-empty"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="ask coho film club"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="coho film club meta"><meta data-rh="true" property="article:tag" content="iri's photography rambles"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image" content="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/avatar/247031-9ee7390b-e79f-43b4-a08e-a9424233e40d-profile.jpeg"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:alt" content="irigraph"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:width" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image:height" content="128"><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:card" content="summary">

i dont almost any film. take that with a grain of salt i guess)\nI think part of it comes down to the like… entire approach ppl come at photography from honestly - you mention the intimacy as the prevailing factor you can think of, but I think it honestly just comes down to a more technical approach of it. I mean I’ve heard more people reaching for 85mm vs 135mm - but I think both of those are used for the same reason over something like a 50mm\n\nI’m not conventionally educated enough in <i> anything </i> related to photography so I’m just like “the vibes! long lens has different vibes!!” but it <i> mostly </i> seems like just the character of the bokeh? It also tends to collapse the background more than 50mm (or shorter but me and wide angles seemingly do not get along (unless I crop hard in which case… its not really a wide angle anymore is it)) in a way that tends to help for a more portrait-y look?\n\n![singer](../../rc/attachment/c25ee084-a06f-4ca9-bfd2-106c245ff060/_DSC8487.jpg)\n\\[Pentax 100-300, probably at full zoom and 4.5 - i know that's way farther but i have neither exif nor fast long lenses; it shows the effect at least.]\n\n![singer](../../rc/attachment/9fda359f-d8d7-4d92-a6be-021b3f37a9cc/_DSC8895.jpg)\n\\[Sony 50mm; definitely at a lower f stop - again, no fast telephotos (maybe soon?)]\n\n(rough edits sorry!!! i refuse to lightroom more than i need to rn)\n\nlike in these two images the drummer goes from being perceptible in the 300mm(i think!!!) to completely not in the 50mm. and I know it's not the same, but I def find myself reaching for my longer lenses when I want to exaggerate the size of buildings or whatever in the background of portraits (i'd post better examples but they're grad photos i did for friends which feels... weird to post.)\n\nWhile 300mm is def longer than 135mm, i think 135 still gets the sorta... vibe. that i like from the longer lenses. its also the amount of bokeh at higher f stops that helps (f./4.5 vs 2.8 at similar amounts) that kinda make me wanna use them for most portrait shots. It's actually kinda funny; the issue with longer lenses not being as intimate is def true, and I <i> do </i> struggle with it. we make do i guess.\n\nalso like Charlotte mentioned - the angles you can get from longer lenses tend to lend towards more interesting (IN MY OPINION!!!!!!) options in terms of backgrounds. (and also lead to really shit backgrounds sometimes. hit or miss ig)\n\nalso also long lenses have been used for portraits for like. ever right? so i think part of it may be that because that's the Portrait Look™ it ends up being good for that. is that a catch 22? idk.\n\nsorry for the length + rambly-ness!!! the question just got me thinking :)\n","children":[{"comment":{"commentId":"7783bb0e-edd7-440a-9899-6d555ebbc32c","postedAtISO":"2024-08-09T09:50:53.605Z","deleted":false,"body":"WAIT I FORGOT I HAD A LONG ZOOM RANGE LENS ON MY NIKON I HAVE MORE OUTDOOR SHOTS THAT SHOW THE TELEPHOTO VIBE\n\n![cat](../../rc/attachment/ef7d2e9d-413c-4ea2-88ed-d168cc23a1a8/20240809_0003.jpg)\n\\[105mm on APS-C - so like 157 or something? closer!]\n\n![cat](../../rc/attachment/b0ff92fa-3648-424c-95c0-14d0abf23f1a/20240809_0004.jpg)\n\\[62mm on APS-C; 93ish?)\n\nthese ones ended up being a touch different; instead of using focal length to amplify the background it ended up making it more non-descript, which (i think) helps exemplify the subject.\n\nOH YEAH AND THE CAMERA I BORROWED THAT HAS A CONSTANT APERTURE ZOOM\n\n![bassist](../../rc/attachment/412b07cd-f4c0-4eb4-8165-a19465ab96db/20240809_0002.jpg)\n\\[24mm Full Frame]\n\n![Guitarist](../../rc/attachment/baf1e38c-0d0e-4e26-bd14-e67817688696/_DSC0116.jpg)\n\\[70mm Full Frame]\n\nthis one is mostly just there cause... im not really a fan of the wide angle look. its just that fisheye-y look that has never really appealed to me i guess? idk - i just prefer the more conventional look from longer lenses i guess.\n\nlittle lame when i put it like that oops.\n","children":[],"postId":7225931,"inReplyTo":"b5f423ac-7918-4e5c-b49f-b8b5ed2c85c3","hasCohostPlus":false,"hidden":false},"canInteract":"not-allowed","canEdit":"not-allowed","canHide":"not-allowed","poster":{"projectId":216058,"handle":"Netscape-Pixie","displayName":"PXE","dek":"im me i swear","description":"manic pixie dream squirrel\r\ngay, transgender, and in your walls\r\ndiscord - @netscapepixie\n","avatarURL":"../../rc/avatar/216058-e0d629ff-aeb1-436b-9eae-8035dce406a2-profile.png","avatarPreviewURL":"../../rc/avatar/216058-e0d629ff-aeb1-436b-9eae-8035dce406a2-profile.png","headerURL":"../../rc/header/216058-f21e07dd-3d33-49ab-aa74-7e37ea9f4a44-profile.jpg","headerPreviewURL":"../../rc/header/216058-f21e07dd-3d33-49ab-aa74-7e37ea9f4a44-profile.jpg","privacy":"public","url":"","pronouns":"she/her","flags":[],"avatarShape":"squircle","loggedOutPostVisibility":"none","frequentlyUsedTags":[],"askSettings":{"enabled":true,"allowAnon":true,"requireLoggedInAnon":true},"contactCard":[{"service":"weird writing page!

The background will be blurred the same amount because it's the same aperture. But they will look completely different because the 400mm has taken a tiny bit of that blurry background and stretched it across the whole frame. The boke is in a sense now bigger, zoomed in on.

But if you do a head shot with this, you will often give your subject a subtly larger nose or chin or whatever body part is closest to the lens. This is sometimes fine, potentially useful if your subject is self conscious of a small nose or big ears. But instead, a longer focal length avoids the problem entirely.\n\nSo 85mm (ff) or 50mm(crop) is a popular length if you are doing head or head and torso shots.\n\n135 seems a bit too long for convenience, but gives basically certainty that you won't distort your subject.\n\nAlso unrelated to that: at 135mm you are less likely to have trouble with your shadow being in the frame.\n\nOther important factors others have mentioned:\n-Longer focal length lets you choose a nice small area of background, if you're in an area with nice bits and ugly bits.\n-Depth of field is controlled by aperture, format/sensor size, and focal length. If you can't change to a larger film format, the best ways to make a smaller depth of field are a longer focal length or a larger aperture. I feel like my 400 f/5.6 has vaguely similar boke to a 50 f/1.8.\n\nI guess that's why 135 f/2.8 is so popular: not too big or expensive while still achieving all of that.\n","children":[{"comment":{"commentId":"77bfee97-fdd3-4022-92d9-d8ddebdb37d7","postedAtISO":"2024-08-10T12:53:33.963Z","deleted":false,"body":"I agree that longer focal lengths are very inconvenient.

<!-- --><p>i will readily admit im a prime &amp; wide angle girlie. i think portraits are more intimate, more full of emotion, when you're in close quarters with someone, but admittedly most of my portrait work is done with people ive known for a long time. is that it??? that 135mm allows you to be further away/more distant from the subject???? &amp; that makes them more comfortable if they don't know you as well??<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>like. the longest lens ive had any portrait success with so far is 55mm on the x-t2 so 82.5mm equivalent, and even then i felt like i was far too distant from my subject to compose the shot the way i wanted. i don't understand :•|<!-- --></p></div></div><div class="w-full max-w-full p-3"><div class="co-tags relative w-full overflow-y-hidden break-words leading-none max-h-[60px]"><div><a class="mr-2 inline-block text-sm hover:underline  " href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/tagged/ask%20coho%20film%20club">#<!-- -->ask coho film club<!-- --></a><a class="mr-2 inline-block text-sm hover:underline  " href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/tagged/coho%20film%20club%20meta">#<!-- -->coho film club meta<!-- --></a><a class="mr-2 inline-block text-sm hover:underline  " href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/tagged/iri's%20photography%20rambles">#<!-- -->iri's photography rambles<!-- --></a></div><div class="absolute bottom-0 right-2 flex h-5"><span class="co-from-body inline-block h-full bg-gradient-to-l pl-4"></span><button class="co-tags co-opaque inline-block cursor-pointer text-sm font-bold hover:underline">see all</button></div></div></div></div></div></div><hr class="co-hairline"><footer class="co-thread-footer w-full max-w-full rounded-b-lg p-3"><div class="flex justify-between align-middle"><div class="w-max flex-none"><a href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/7233959-empty#comments" class="text-sm hover:underline">22 comments<!-- --></a></div><div class="flex items-center justify-end gap-3"><div style="position:fixed;top:1px;left:1px;width:1px;height:0;padding:0;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border-width:0;display:none"></div><div style="position:fixed;top:1px;left:1px;width:1px;height:0;padding:0;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border-width:0;display:none"></div><div style="position:fixed;top:1px;left:1px;width:1px;height:0;padding:0;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border-width:0;display:none"></div><button title="delete this post"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="co-action-button h-6 w-6"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M14.74 9l-.346 9m-4.788 0L9.26 9m9.968-3.21c.342.052.682.107 1.022.166m-1.022-.165L18.16 19.673a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.244 2.077H8.084a2.25 2.25 0 01-2.244-2.077L4.772 5.79m14.456 0a48.108 48.108 0 00-3.478-.397m-12 .562c.34-.059.68-.114 1.022-.165m0 0a48.11 48.11 0 013.478-.397m7.5 0v-.916c0-1.18-.91-2.164-2.09-2.201a51.964 51.964 0 00-3.32 0c-1.18.037-2.09 1.022-2.09 2.201v.916m7.5 0a48.667 48.667 0 00-7.5 0"></path></svg></button><a href="https://cohost.org/amberisvibin/post/7233959-empty/edit" class="co-action-button h-6 w-6" title="edit this post"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M16.862 4.487l1.687-1.688a1.875 1.875 0 112.652 2.652L10.582 16.07a4.5 4.5 0 01-1.897 1.13L6 18l.8-2.685a4.5 4.5 0 011.13-1.897l8.932-8.931zm0 0L19.5 7.125M18 14v4.75A2.25 2.25 0 0115.75 21H5.25A2.25 2.25 0 013 18.75V8.25A2.25 2.25 0 015.25 6H10"></path></svg></a><button class="w-6 h-6 pointer relative" title="unlike this post as amberisvibin"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 24 24" fill="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="w-6 h-6 pointer absolute top-0 left-0 text-cherry visible"><path d="M11.645 20.91l-.007-.003-.022-.012a15.247 15.247 0 01-.383-.218 25.18 25.18 0 01-4.244-3.17C4.688 15.36 2.25 12.174 2.25 8.25 2.25 5.322 4.714 3 7.688 3A5.5 5.5 0 0112 5.052 5.5 5.5 0 0116.313 3c2.973 0 5.437 2.322 5.437 5.25 0 3.925-2.438 7.111-4.739 9.256a25.175 25.175 0 01-4.244 3.17 15.247 15.247 0 01-.383.219l-.022.012-.007.004-.003.001a.752.752 0 01-.704 0l-.003-.001z"></path></svg><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="currentColor" aria-hidden="true" class="w-6 h-6 pointer absolute top-0 left-0 co-action-button invisible"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M21 8.25c0-2.485-2.099-4.5-4.688-4.5-1.935 0-3.597 1.126-4.312 2.733-.715-1.607-2.377-2.733-4.313-2.733C5.1 3.75 3 5.765 3 8.25c0 7.22 9 12 9 12s9-4.78 9-12z"></path></svg></button></div></div></footer></article><div id="comments" class="relative -top-16"></div><div data-theme="both" class="co-themed-box co-comment-box cohost-shadow-light dark:cohost-shadow-dark w-full max-w-full rounded-lg p-3 lg:max-w-prose"><div class="flex flex-col gap-4"><div class="relative grid w-full overflow-auto"><div class="invisible col-start-1 col-end-2 row-start-1 row-end-2

<!-- -->I think part of it comes down to the like… entire approach ppl come at photography from honestly - you mention the intimacy as the prevailing factor you can think of, but I think it honestly just comes down to a more technical approach of it. I mean I’ve heard more people reaching for 85mm vs 135mm - but I think both of those are used for the same reason over something like a 50mm<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>I’m not conventionally educated enough in <!-- --> anything <!-- --> related to photography so I’m just like “the vibes! long lens has different vibes!!” but it <!-- --> mostly <!-- --> seems like just the character of the bokeh? It also tends to collapse the background more than 50mm (or shorter but me and wide angles seemingly do not get along (unless I crop hard in which case… its not really a wide angle anymore is it)) in a way that tends to help for a more portrait-y look?<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>(rough edits sorry!!! i refuse to lightroom more than i need to rn)<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>like in these two images the drummer goes from being perceptible in the 300mm(i think!!!) to completely not in the 50mm. and I know it's not the same, but I def find myself reaching for my longer lenses when I want to exaggerate the size of buildings or whatever in the background of portraits (i'd post better examples but they're grad photos i did for friends which feels... weird to post.)<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>While 300mm is def longer than 135mm, i think 135 still gets the sorta... vibe. that i like from the longer lenses. its also the amount of bokeh at higher f stops that helps (f./4.5 vs 2.8 at similar amounts) that kinda make me wanna use them for most portrait shots. It's actually kinda funny; the issue with longer lenses not being as intimate is def true, and I <!-- --> do <!-- --> struggle with it. we make do i guess.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>also like Charlotte mentioned - the angles you can get from longer lenses tend to lend towards more interesting (IN MY OPINION!!!!!!) options in terms of backgrounds. (and also lead to really shit backgrounds sometimes. hit or miss ig)<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>also also long lenses have been used for portraits for like. ever right? so i think part of it may be that because that's the Portrait Look™ it ends up being good for that. is that a catch 22? idk.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>so<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>when i do portraiture i usually use pretty wide apertures. like f2, f1.8, f1.4... my "dream lens" is probably honestly a leica 50mm noctilux, f0.95 goodness....... anyway. when i was reading all these things about how short telephotos have such great bokeh i could not understand at all because their max aperture is like f4 or f3.5, and in the times i had used telephotos it just did not feel the same to shooting a 50mm or 24mm with f1.4 at all. then i realized it's less about the bokeh itself, and more about the direction the background moves<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>with the lenses i usually use, the background moves like this when blurred to bokeh<!-- --><br>

<!-- --><p>i think the change of direction happens around 70 or 80-some-odd mm because that's where i was struggling the most and where bokeh started to feel "flat" in a way i couldn't describe. i shot my partner a little today with a vivitar 70-150mm f3.8 md mount lens, so once adapted to fuji X about 105-225mm, and that started making a lot more sense to use (vs the 200-800mm telephoto that i just for the life of me could not get along with...)<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>If we imagine a 50mm and 400mm taking a photo at say, f/5.6. The background will be blurred the same amount because it's the same aperture. But they will look completely different because the 400mm has taken a tiny bit of that blurry background and stretched it across the whole frame. The boke is in a sense now bigger, zoomed in on.

<!-- --><p>Less extreme than that: 50mm (full frame) or 35mm (crop) is usually ok if you aren't too close, great for full body portraits. But if you do a head shot with this, you will often give your subject a subtly larger nose or chin or whatever body part is closest to the lens. This is sometimes fine, potentially useful if your subject is self conscious of a small nose or big ears. But instead, a longer focal length avoids the problem entirely.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>So 85mm (ff) or 50mm(crop) is a popular length if you are doing head or head and torso shots.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>135 seems a bit too long for convenience, but gives basically certainty that you won't distort your subject.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Also unrelated to that: at 135mm you are less likely to have trouble with your shadow being in the frame.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Other important factors others have mentioned:<!-- --><br>
<!-- -->-Longer focal length lets you choose a nice small area of background, if you're in an area with nice bits and ugly bits.<!-- --><br>
<!-- -->-Depth of field is controlled by aperture, format/sensor size, and focal length. If you can't change to a larger film format, the best ways to make a smaller depth of field are a longer focal length or a larger aperture.

class="co-prose prose overflow-hidden break-words"><p>alright so that's the thing: i don't really care about taking "realistic" pictures. in fact i somewhat intentionally somewhat intuitively never do, i think about making photographs like i think about making surrealist paintings. i love fisheyes and wide angles. some of my favorite portraits were taken focusing a 16mm (crop so 24mm) f1.4 wide open focusing about 8 inches from the subject's face. displaying undistorted reality has never been a priority for me i very intentional take snapshots of reality in distortion. for one reason or another my own reality is near always distorted somehow, hence why i say "surrealism is realism". 50mm just lets me get a lot of the environment in, and even if it's just a complicated mess of bokeh i love environmental portraits. portraits without context are boring to me, not something i have any intention of working on if i can avoid it. so i don't see the lens angle distortion as a "problem" but rather a feature to play with<!-- --></p></div><div class="flex flex-row items-center gap-2"><span class="co-link-button-disabled flex cursor-not-allowed
